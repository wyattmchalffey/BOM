## Orcs — The Starbound Exiles

### One-Sentence Identity
The Orcs are a fallen empire of conquerors who survived collapse by mastering desert scarcity, blood rites, and star-guided necromancy.

### Historical Arc
- **Age of Dominion:** Orc war-clans unified and ruled much of the fertile heartlands, becoming the strongest military power on the continent.
- **Age of Overreach:** Success led to simultaneous campaigns against multiple rival factions, stretching supply lines and fracturing leadership.
- **Age of Breaking:** A coordinated pushback by their enemies shattered the empire; surviving clans were displaced into the Great Desert.
- **Age of Ash and Stars (Current):** Reduced in territory but hardened in spirit, the Orcs endure as nomadic desert tribes with dangerous spiritual power.

### Homeland and Adaptation
- **Region:** The Great Desert, once considered uninhabitable by settled kingdoms.
- **Survival Model:** Mobile camps, scavenging routes, hidden oases, and strict preservation rites for food and water.
- **Ecological Knowledge:** They can harvest sustenance from seemingly barren terrain through drought crops, sand-traps, nocturnal hunting, and bone-farm fungus cultivation.
- **Strategic Advantage:** Outsiders underestimate the desert; Orcs use terrain mastery, heat discipline, and night movement to outmaneuver stronger armies.

### Faith and Cosmology
- **Primary Patrons:** The sibling deities of the Moon and the Stars.
- **Core Belief:** The sky is a record of debt and destiny; each life taken, spared, or sacrificed leaves a mark in the heavens.
- **Ritual Practice:** Long desert nights are used for divination, constellation reading, and omen-binding.
- **Religious Role:** Divinators are both priests and military advisors, deciding when clans migrate, raid, or perform sacrificial rites.

### Magic Identity
- **Blood Magic:** Life-force transmutation used for empowerment, binding oaths, and fueling war rites.
- **Necromancy:** The dead are recalled as temporary servants, ancestral guardians, or battlefield revenants.
- **Star Invocation:** Moonlight and starlight are treated as conduits that stabilize otherwise volatile blood-and-bone sorcery.
- **Cultural Rule:** Magic is communal, not private—power drawn from sacrifice is owed back to the clan.

### Society and Culture
- **Political Structure:** Confederated clans led by war-chiefs, omen-seers, and ritual elders.
- **Social Values:** Endurance, loyalty, debt-honor, and usefulness to the clan.
- **View of the Past:** They do not deny their imperial cruelty; they interpret exile as both punishment and refinement.
- **View of Rivals:** Settled factions are seen as soft but dangerous—prosperous, numerous, and prone to betrayal.

### Military Doctrine
- **Current Style:** Precision raids, attritional warfare, corpse reclamation, and terror tactics under moonlit conditions.
- **Strengths:** High resilience, resource conversion from casualties, and powerful late-battle momentum through necromantic recursion.
- **Weaknesses:** Limited infrastructure, dependence on ritual specialists, and vulnerability when forced into prolonged daylight sieges.

### Internal Tensions (Story Hooks)
- **Restorationists vs. Renunciants:** One side seeks to rebuild the old empire; the other believes conquest caused divine judgment.
- **Debt of the Dead:** Some clans question whether repeated necromancy dishonors ancestors rather than preserving them.
- **Star Schism:** Competing divination schools read different futures in the same constellations, causing political fractures.


### Card Database Signal Traits (Orc)
- **No-Free-Draw Pressure:** The Encampment skips normal draw, reinforcing a scavenger culture that must earn knowledge through rites, raids, or engineered draw engines.
- **Sacrifice Economy as Statecraft:** Crypts, Altars, Blood Divinators, and Blood Boil all reward converting allied bodies into blood, bones, or direct damage.
- **The Living and the Dead as Distinct Castes:** Many effects explicitly care about **non-Undead** deaths, framing undead labor/warfare as a parallel social system rather than normal clan life.
- **Monument Theology:** Monument of the Star God and monument-cost cards (Gargoyle, Stone Golem, Stone Toss) imply star worship is institutionalized through sacred architecture and wonder counters.
- **Warrior-Worker Blurring:** Grunts are workers with Warrior subtype, matching lore that Orc labor culture is militarized and every body is battlefield-relevant.
- **Graveyard Logistics:** Temple of the Stars, Skelieutenant, Necromancer, and Carrion Pit establish formal corpse recovery and undead redeployment doctrine.
- **Raid Identity:** Raiding Outpost (resource theft and double-attack enabler) confirms the faction fantasy of predatory, momentum-based strikes.

### External Story Hooks
- A rare celestial convergence is predicted to amplify Orc ritual power for one season.
- A fertile border city secretly hires Orc divinators, risking scandal and religious panic.
- Ancient imperial Orc relics are discovered beneath rival territory, reigniting claims to the heartlands.

### Tone Keywords
Fallen empire, desert endurance, ritual austerity, omen warfare, sacred debt, moonlit brutality.

## Elves — The Ember Schism

### One-Sentence Identity
The Elves are an ancient civilization centered on the World Tree, now torn between water-bound tradition and a revolutionary fire cult seeking rebirth through destruction.

### Historical Arc
- **Age of Rooted Sovereignty:** Elven houses built a long-lived civilization around the World Tree and resisted absorption by outside empires.
- **Age of Orc Ascendancy:** While most factions were subdued, the Elves remained unconquered through rigid conservatism, defensive doctrine, and refusal to overextend.
- **Age of Necessary Alliance:** During the anti-Orc coalition wars, the Elves broke isolation and coordinated with Humans and allied tribes to drive back Orc expansion.
- **Age of Diffusion:** Trade, diplomacy, and shared warfare seeded foreign ideas into Elven society, eroding absolute traditional authority over generations.
- **Age of Embers (Current):** Conservative rule is at its weakest point; reformist and revolutionary factions now wage civil conflict over the future of the kingdom.

### Homeland and Civic Structure
- **Core Polity:** A vast mega-city built in concentric districts around the World Tree.
- **Hydraulic Lifeline:** Aqueduct channels and sacred waterways are believed to carry the Water Goddess’s blessing through every district.
- **Peripheral Reach:** Outlying groves, watch-forts, and tributary settlements orbit the capital but remain politically subordinate to the city’s ritual councils.
- **Urban Character:** Vertical gardens, shrine canals, and living-wood architecture reflect reverence for continuity and controlled growth.

### Faith and Cosmology
- **Orthodox Patron:** The Water Goddess, source of renewal, fertility, and civic balance.
- **Sacred Axis:** The World Tree is treated as a divine covenant—its health is synonymous with the legitimacy of the kingdom.
- **Orthodox Rite:** Seasonal flood rites, root-blessings, and purification ceremonies regulate both religion and governance.
- **The Heresy of Flame:** Insurgent sects revere the Fire God as the patron of change, trial, and historical transcendence.

### Magic Identity
- **Water Tradition:** Healing flow magic, warding mist, and life-channeling rites tied to the World Tree’s circulatory waters.
- **Fire Innovation:** Volatile ember rites, purification flames, and weaponized heat magic favored by revolutionary cells.
- **Doctrinal Divide:** Traditionalists define fire as corruption; rebels define it as necessary transformation.
- **Ritual Catastrophe Risk:** Extremist revolutionaries plan a grand immolation rite to burn the World Tree and summon the Aspect of Fire.

### Society and Culture
- **Historic Social Order:** House-based hierarchy, elder councils, and strict codes of ritual purity and cultural continuity.
- **Isolationist Legacy:** Past enslavement of captured Elves by foreign cultures hardened xenophobia and inward-looking policy.
- **Post-War Drift:** Veterans, envoys, and merchants normalized outside customs, speech, and military methods.
- **Current Fracture:** Families split across ideological lines; even temples and military cohorts are no longer politically unified.

### Military Doctrine
- **Traditional Doctrine:** Defensive warfare, chokepoint control, archery lines, and terrain shaping around waterways and grove corridors.
- **Coalition Legacy:** Joint command practices learned during the anti-Orc wars increased strategic flexibility but diluted insular command culture.
- **Revolutionary Tactics:** Sabotage, shrine-burnings, targeted assassinations, and symbolic attacks meant to delegitimize tree-centered rule.
- **Strategic Weakness:** The kingdom’s greatest strength—centralization around one sacred city—has become a critical vulnerability in civil war.

### Internal Tensions (Story Hooks)
- **Crown vs. Cinder:** Loyalists seek to preserve the Water Covenant while insurgents seek to inaugurate an Age of Fire.
- **Temple Schism:** Younger clergy reinterpret old prophecies as cyclical destruction, challenging orthodox theology.
- **House Realignment:** Neutral houses sell support to either side, turning civil conflict into a shifting political market.


### Card Database Signal Traits (Elf)
- **Hydraulic Governance Is Mechanical, Not Just Poetic:** Watermill/Waterfall/Wishing Well stack explicit **Water Level**, implying civic power is measured through managed flow infrastructure.
- **Tree Administration Through Counters:** Plan of Growth and Plan of Retribution turn Tree growth counters into policy choices (cultivation vs. weaponized expenditure).
- **Orthodoxy Gating:** Temple of the Old Gods requiring a sacred structure with 8+ counters suggests priestly institutions regulate who can field high-order water rites.
- **Institutionalized Revolution:** Rebellion Center and Revolutionary units show the uprising has supply chains, doctrine, and fire-conversion economics—not just street unrest.
- **Escaped Helot Legacy:** The worker being named **Escaped Helot** canonizes slavery memory as a present-tense social wound, not distant history.
- **Tri-Path Warfare:** Archery (first-strike ranged), Beast lines, and Elemental Wood/Water/Fire lines indicate multiple competing military schools inside one kingdom.
- **Mobility and Reclamation Toolkit:** Water bounce units, Bloodhound structure recovery, and woody self-recursion imply elves excel at repositioning and reclaiming assets instead of pure attrition.
- **Civil-War Endgame Is Already Printed:** Flame Demon can optionally destroy the Tree of Life to wipe non-workers, matching the revolutionary apocalyptic doctrine in playable form.

### External Story Hooks
- Human diplomats attempt mediation while secretly arming opposing Elven factions for leverage.
- Orc seers interpret the Elven fire uprising as an omen tied to their own star prophecies.
- Rumors spread that the Aspect of Fire has already manifested in dreams near the roots of the World Tree.

### Historical Arc
- **Age of Settlement:** Human polities expanded through farms, quarries, and timber networks, creating dense, defensible population centers.
- **Age of Subjugation and Bargain:** During Orc imperial expansion, many Human domains bent, paid, or stalled—learning that survival often came through logistics rather than glory.
- **Age of Coalition War:** Humans became key coordinators in anti-Orc alliance warfare, leveraging supply chains, command doctrine, and mixed-arms discipline.

### Homeland and Civic Structure
- **Core Polity:** Castle-centered city-states tied together by roads, trade ledgers, and bureaucratic administration.
- **Settlement Character:** Productive hinterlands (farmland, mills, storage works) feed urban workshops and military yards.
- **Class Infrastructure:** Peasant labor, merchant finance, scholar bureaus, and royal command exist as interlocking civic functions.
- **Imperial Temperament:** Humans frame expansion as “order and development,” even when neighbors experience it as encroachment.

### Faith and Cosmology

- **Strategic Strengths:** Robust economy, flexible tech paths, scalable card advantage, and high late-game command payoffs.
- **Strategic Weaknesses:** Reliance on infrastructure, gold/knowledge setup time, and vulnerability when supply nodes are disrupted.

### Internal Tensions (Story Hooks)
- **Crown vs. Guild:** Merchant houses and financiers challenge royal authority over war budgets and public policy.
- **Sword vs. Scholar:** Military traditionalists distrust the growing influence of alchemists and technocrats.
- **Bread vs. Engine:** Rural communities resist being overtaxed to fund machines, libraries, and elite urban projects.

### Card Database Signal Traits (Human)

## Gnomes — The Requiem on the Moving Shell

### One-Sentence Identity
The Gnomes are a nearly broken, long-lived people who survived extinction by binding their dead into spirit-machines and rebuilding society atop Reiki, the Great Spirit Turtle.

### Historical Arc
- **Age of Bright Continuance:** For ages, Gnome communities lived with near-immortal horizons, innovation, and little cultural memory of mass bereavement.
- **Age of First Collapse:** In the Great War, they were among the earliest major peoples to fall, and their low population was devastated beyond replacement.
- **Age of Griefcraft:** Faced with unprecedented loss, Gnome artificers fused mourning rites with military engineering to create vessels for lingering souls.
- **Age of the Moving Sanctuary (Current):** Reiki took in the survivors, and the Gnomes now rebuild as a caravan-civilization traveling the world to gather soul remnants.

### Homeland and Civic Structure
- **Living Homeland:** Their "capital" is mobile—districts, workshops, sanctuaries, and foundries built across Reiki’s shell.
- **Population Reality:** They remain one of the smallest peoples, forcing strict role specialization and careful stewardship of every life.

### Faith and Cosmology
- **Primary Patron:** Reiki, the Great Spirit Turtle, revered as guardian, vessel, and witness of the dead.
- **Core Doctrine:** Souls are not “spent”; they are redirected, housed, and given renewed purpose through ethical spirit-binding.
- **Requiem Practice:** Recovery rites identify, calm, and recover fragmented soul-echoes before integrating them into machine cores.
- **Moral Boundary:** Binding is viewed as sacred duty when consensual or ancestral; coercive soul-forging is treated as taboo.

### Magic and Technology Identity

- **Crystal Harmonics:** Crystal acts as amplifier and stabilizer for advanced channeling, divination, and augmentation systems.
- **Machine-Priest Tradition:** Clerics and engineers co-develop cathedrals, academies, and workshops as one discipline.
- **Design Principle:** Their strongest tools are hybrid—equal parts ritual, mathematics, and battlefield pragmatism.

### Society and Culture
- **Dominant Emotion:** Collective grief transformed into obligation: no spirit abandoned, no memory discarded.
- **Cultural Temperament:** Still inventive and curious, but now deliberate, ceremonial, and protective of the few who remain.
- **Social Roles:** Ecto-engineers, requiem clergy, spirit handlers, and salvage scouts form the backbone of daily life.
- **View of War:** War is no longer glory or necessity—it is a recurring disaster to be survived, archived, and repurposed.

### Military Doctrine
- **Core Method:** Field Spirit Mechs as repositories of ancestral will, supported by clerics and mages that recycle spiritual energy.
- **Strengths:** High recursion, strong utility control, scalable crystal power, and precision burst tools.
- **Weaknesses:** Low manpower, dependence on soul-fuel ecosystems, and fragility if worker-crew lines are disrupted.
- **Strategic Identity:** Win through endurance loops, resource conversion, and technical superiority rather than territorial mass.

### Internal Tensions (Story Hooks)
- **Sanctity vs. Expedience:** Purists demand strict soul-consent rites; hardliners want faster, looser binding to survive looming threats.
- **Shell Succession Debate:** Some propose permanent city-state settlement; others insist motion is essential to Reiki’s covenant.
- **Memory Saturation:** Repeated spirit integration blurs personal identity in some pilots, raising fear of cultural dissolution.

### Card Database Signal Traits (Gnome)
