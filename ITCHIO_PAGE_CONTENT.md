# Siegecraft

**Siegecraft** is a 1v1 competitive card game that plays like an RTS — build workers, gather resources, construct buildings, raise armies, and destroy your opponent's base. Two radically different factions, each with their own economy, units, and win conditions.

This is an early alpha built by a solo developer. The full game loop is playable, multiplayer works, and I'm actively developing it. If you're into card games and want to help shape one from the ground up, I'd love to have you.

## How It Plays

Each turn you'll manage workers, build structures from your blueprint deck, play units and spells from your hand, and decide when to attack. Games are fast and decision-dense — every worker you assign, every unit you summon, and every attack you declare has a real cost.

**Workers produce resources.** Assign them to Food, Wood, or Stone nodes — or to specialized structures that convert basic resources into faction-specific ones like Gold, Metal, Blood, or Bones.

**Structures come from a separate blueprint deck.** Build farms to feed your army, barracks to deploy warriors, altars to sacrifice the fallen. Your structures define your strategy as much as your cards do.

**Units cost upkeep.** You can't just flood the board — armies decay if you can't feed them. Every unit you keep alive is a choice.

**Combat is attacker-favored but defender-controlled.** Declare attackers, pick targets (enemy base or enemy units), and the defender assigns blockers. First Strike, Trample, Deathtouch, and Flying all interact the way you'd expect.

## The Factions

### Humans — The Ledger Crown
Disciplined empire-builders who turn labor and knowledge into military dominance.

- Scale through passive production — Farmlands, Banks, Mints, Libraries
- **Knowledge counters** on Scholars and Philosophers fuel card draw and unlock powerful plays
- Tech tree progression through Blacksmith — research upgrades that stack across your army
- Late-game payoff: **King of Man** buffs every Warrior for each Scholar you control
- Playstyle: build infrastructure, accumulate knowledge, then overwhelm with a coordinated push

### Orcs — The Starbound Exiles
A fallen empire of desert necromancers who turn death itself into a resource.

- **No free card draw** — the Orc base skips your normal draw step, forcing you to build draw engines or earn cards through play
- Dead units become **Blood** and **Bones** through sacrificial altars and crypts
- Bones fuel an **undead recursion loop** — your fallen warriors come back as skeletons that don't need upkeep
- **Fighting Pits** let you sacrifice a warrior to summon the next tier up — workers are Rank 0 warriors, so everything feeds the chain
- **Raiding Outpost** steals enemy resources every time you hit their base
- Playstyle: build a sacrifice engine, convert losses into momentum, raid relentlessly

## Current Alpha Features

- Full playable game loop with win/loss conditions
- 2 asymmetric factions (Humans and Orcs) with 30+ cards each
- Worker placement and resource management on your board
- Separate blueprint deck for structures
- Unit combat with keywords (First Strike, Trample, Flying, Rush, Deathtouch, Vigilance)
- Activated abilities, triggered effects, and upkeep costs
- Online multiplayer (host-authoritative, websocket-based, with reconnect support)
- LAN and internet play via relay server
- Deterministic replay recording and export
- In-game bug report form

## What's Coming

- 2 more factions (Elves and Gnomes — designed, not yet implemented)
- Deck builder with custom decklist support
- Art and visual identity pass
- Balance tuning based on playtester feedback
- Steam Early Access (eventually)

## I Need Your Help

This game is being built by one person. If any of this sounds interesting to you:

- **Play it** and tell me what you think — join the Discord and find a match
- **Break it** — I want bug reports, weird edge cases, exploits you find
- **Talk about it** — balance opinions, card ideas, faction strategy discussion all welcome
- **If you're an artist** — I'm looking for collaborators. The lore runs deep (necromantic desert orcs, civil-war elves, grief-engineer gnomes riding a spirit turtle). Come check out the world and see if it speaks to you.

## Devlog Post #1 — First Post Draft

Title: **"What is Siegecraft? (And why I'm building it alone)"**

---

I've been working on Siegecraft for a while now and it's finally at a point where I can put it in front of people without too much embarrassment.

**The pitch:** Siegecraft is a 1v1 competitive card game that plays like a card-game version of an RTS. You build workers, assign them to resource nodes, construct buildings, research tech, raise armies, and try to destroy the other player's base. Two factions that play completely differently from each other — Humans build knowledge-driven empires, Orcs run sacrifice-and-necromancy engines that turn their own dead into fuel.

**Where it came from:** I wanted to take the feeling of an RTS — the base-building, the worker management, the "which tech path do I go" decisions — and compress it into a card game where every choice matters and games don't take an hour. Siegecraft is the result.

**Where it's at right now:**
- Full game loop works — you can sit down, pick a faction, play a match, and get a winner
- Two factions are playable (Humans and Orcs), each with 30+ cards
- Online multiplayer works — host-authoritative with websocket networking, reconnect support, deterministic replays
- Basically zero art. I'm a programmer, not an artist. The game is functional but visually it's placeholder city

**What I need:**
- **Playtesters.** The game is free to download. If you like card games and want to try something rough but real, I'd love to hear what you think. The Discord is where matches happen.
- **Feedback.** Not "it's cool" feedback — I want to know what confused you, what felt broken, what made you want to play again (or not).
- **Eventually, an artist.** I have deep lore for four factions and zero ability to draw them. If you're an artist who likes fantasy worldbuilding and wants to help shape a game from early on, come say hi.

Thanks for reading. First alpha build is up — go break it for me.

## Screenshot Captions (for when you have screenshots)

If itch.io lets you caption your screenshots, here are suggestions:

1. "Assign workers to resource nodes — every worker placement is a strategic decision"
2. "Build structures from your blueprint deck to shape your economy and army"
3. "Orcs sacrifice their own units to fuel a necromantic recursion engine"
4. "Online multiplayer with host-authoritative networking and reconnect support"
